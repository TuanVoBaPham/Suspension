**Quarter-Car Suspension Model (Simulink)**
-----
This repository contains Simulink models for simulating the dynamic behavior of a quarter-car suspension system, which represents the vertical dynamics of a single wheel of a vehicle.
The models are commonly used to study ride comfort, suspension performance, and vibration isolation.

**quartercar_model.slx**
<br>
Simulink model of a quarter-car suspension system.
<br>
Represents the dynamic interaction between the sprung mass and unsprung mass.
<br>
Includes suspension stiffness and damping to simulate vertical vehicle motion.
<br>
Suitable for basic analysis of suspension response to road disturbances.

**quartercar_model2.slx**
<br>
An alternative version of the quarter-car suspension model.
<br>
Include
<br>
Modified parameters (spring/damper values)
<br>
Different excitation or road input models
<br>
Used for comparison, validation, or further development of the suspension dynamics.
